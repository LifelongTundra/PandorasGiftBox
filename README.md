# Pandora's Gift Box - A Lethal Company Mod

This is my first attempt at a mod for any game hope you enjoy!

## What does it do?

When someone opens one of the normally spawning presents the current time will jump in relation to the current time the present was opened.

| Time opened | Added Time |
|-------------|------------|
| Before 12pm | +4 hours   |
| Before 5pm  | +3 hours   | 
| After 5pm   | +1 hours   |

(Note: When opening during the 12pm to 5pm range, the addition of time will stop at 5pm. Not super sure why)

In addition it will up the max spawn power and set the minimum enemies to spawn to the same levels as if the moon was eclipsed + 1.

## Does this work with other mods?

This should in theory work with other mods, as long as it doesn't remove or rename the gift box item, with mods that add new monsters, and ones that allow inside monsters to spawn outside/leave.

## Any other plans for the mod?

Ideally make the reward for opening a present to be slightly better, even though this is a gag mod that anyone can play around for the downside of losing time and more enemies I feel a better reward is appropriate. In addition, I would like to eventually add in a specific item for this instead of changing the gift box.
