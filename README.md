# Pandora's Gift Box - A Lethal Company Mod

This is my first attempt at a mod for any game hope you enjoy!

## What does it do?

When someone opens one of the normally spawning presents it will jump the time to 12 pm, unless it has past in which case it adds an hour. In addition it will up the spawn probability and set the minimum enemies to spawn to the same levels as if the moon was eclipsed.

## Does this work with other mods?

This should in theory work with other mods, as long as it doesn't remove or rename the gift box item, and with mods that add new monsters or allow inside monsters to spawn outside.

## Any other plans for the mod?

Ideally make the reward for opening a present to be slightly better, even though this is a gag mod that anyone can play around for the downside of losing an hour and more enemies I feel a better reward is appropriate. In addition I would like to eventually add in a specific item for this instead of changing the gift box.
